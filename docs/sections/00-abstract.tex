\begin{abstract}
In this study, an intelligent vehicle that is autonomously controlled is introduced in a highway model with a traffic inflow where phantom traffic congestion occurs. The autonomously controlled vehicles implement a V2V communication system that shares information on speed and position of each autonomous vehicle along with the direction of the vehicles. The behavior of autonomous vehicles is ideal compared to human-driven vehicles thus the acceleration and breaking aim to prevent phantom traffic jams. Based on the ratio between the autonomous vehicles and human-driven vehicles the results shows that with 60\% of autonomous vehicles the flow of vehicles passing the highway is doubled compared to no autonomous vehicles. With 80\% of autonomous vehicles, the flow almost reaches the upper limit only increasing slightly if the autonomous vehicles parameter is brought up to 100\%.
